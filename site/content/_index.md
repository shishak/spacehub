    Astronaut Scott Kelly’s DNA was altered by a year in space, results from
    NASA’s Twins Study have confirmed. Seven percent of his genes did not return
    to normal after he landed, researchers found.


    Scott Kelly and his twin brother, Mark Kelly—also an astronaut—were the
    subjects of the study that sought to find out exactly what happens to the
    body after a year in space.


    Scott stayed on the International Space Station from March 2015 to March
    2016, while Mark remained on Earth. This was the final mission for Scott,
    who spent a total of 520 days in space during his career.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
